# To-do-list-manager-Project
<br>
this is my self made project.

A to-do list manager project in Python is a great way to practice programming and problem-solving skills. Here's a simple example of a console-based to-do list manager.

Project Structure

The to-do list manager will have the following features:

1.Add a new task.
2.View all tasks.
3.Mark a task as completed.
4.Delete a task.
5.Save and load tasks from a file.
